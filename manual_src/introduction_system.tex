\chapter{Introduction}
This manual is focused on advanced architectural structures of JMT.
It is intended for advanced users that want to interface JMT
computational engines with third party software, or to interact
directly with the XML data layer. More details on the computational
algorithms are also provided.

This manual will not cover any aspect of normal user interaction
with the suite, for such documentation please refer to \emph{JMT
users manual}.
